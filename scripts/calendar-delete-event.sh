# Delete a single calendar event via calendar-agent, and prove what happened.
#
# Usage: calendar-delete-event.sh <event_id> [calendar_id]
#
# Environment:
#   CALENDAR_AGENT_URL              base URL of calendar-agent (required)
#   CALENDAR_AGENT_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT  calendar-agent's own mutation budget in
#                                   seconds — its PROXY_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT
#                                   (default 330). The script cannot read it
#                                   across the container boundary; keep them
#                                   in step by hand.
#   CALENDAR_DELETE_MAX_TIME        curl deadline for the DELETE, seconds
#                                   (default: budget + 10 = 340). Must be
#                                   greater than the budget: refused otherwise.
#   CALENDAR_DELETE_VERIFY_MAX_TIME curl deadline for the verifying GET,
#                                   seconds (default 35; the re-read is an
#                                   ordinary 30s-bounded read, not a gated
#                                   mutation).
#
# Worst case the script runs for MAX_TIME + VERIFY_MAX_TIME (375s by default).
# Callers must allow at least that — a harness that kills the script earlier
# kills it before the verification step, which is the only part that
# establishes anything.
#
# Deletes are gated on a human operator, who may take minutes to answer, so the
# response to the DELETE is not evidence of anything: it can be a claim of
# success for work that has not happened, or a timeout for work that is still
# going to happen. This script therefore decides by re-reading the event, and
# reports distinct outcomes (issue #4):
#
#   exit 0  SUCCESS   the event is gone (404, or status "cancelled")
#   exit 1  FAILURE   the event is still there and nothing is outstanding
#   exit 2  UNKNOWN   the event is still there but the deletion may yet land,
#                     or the re-read could not establish either
#   exit 3  NOT FOUND the DELETE itself answered 404/410 - the event id (or
#                     calendar id) did not exist before this script ran, so
#                     nothing was deleted. A re-read that also 404s is not
#                     evidence of a completed deletion; check the id.
#   exit 4  USAGE     bad arguments or configuration; nothing was attempted
#
# Callers must treat exit 2 as "do not act": in particular, never create a
# replacement event until a delete is observed complete.
#
# Deliberately narrow: it can only ever issue one DELETE and one GET against
# calendar-agent's /calendars/{id}/events/{id} route. It never retries, because
# a retry enqueues a second approval request for the same operation.
